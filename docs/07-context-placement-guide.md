# Research Context vs Forecast Context: Placement Guide

## Key Distinction

**Research Context** = **WHAT to look for, WHERE to search, WHAT sources to prioritize**
- Guides the information gathering phase
- Tells the researcher what to search for
- Directs attention to specific topics, patterns, or sources
- Helps find relevant information

**Forecast Context** = **HOW to interpret information, WHAT assumptions to make, HOW to weight factors**
- Guides the forecasting/interpretation phase
- Tells the forecaster how to think about the information
- Provides assumptions and biases to apply
- Helps make predictions from the research

## Analysis of Your Current Statements

### Statement 1: "Assume that 2026 will be a more turbulent year than the previous 20 years"
**Current Location**: Research Context  
**Better Location**: **Forecast Context** ✅

**Reasoning**: This is a forecasting assumption about how to interpret events, not an instruction about what to search for. The researcher doesn't need to "assume" turbulence - they should just find information. The forecaster uses this assumption to weight probabilities.

### Statement 2: "Look for similar patterns in the years preceding World War I, World War II, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union"
**Current Location**: Research Context  
**Better Location**: **Research Context** ✅ (Correct!)

**Reasoning**: This directly tells the researcher WHAT to look for - historical patterns. This is perfect for research context as it guides the search process.

### Statement 3: "Give much more weight to actions than to words. Assume that public political statements might serve to conceal true goals, especially statements from Trump"
**Current Location**: Research Context  
**Better Location**: **Forecast Context** ✅

**Reasoning**: This is about HOW to interpret information (weighting actions vs words) and WHAT assumptions to make (statements may conceal goals). The researcher should find both actions and words; the forecaster decides how to weight them.

### Statement 4: "Assume that politicians and companies are becoming more greedy and selfish than usual and are prioritizing short-term goals in the hope that, long-term, it will sort itself out somehow"
**Current Location**: Research Context  
**Better Location**: **Forecast Context** ✅

**Reasoning**: This is a forecasting assumption about how to interpret behavior, not a research instruction. The researcher should find information about politicians/companies; the forecaster uses this assumption to interpret that information.

## Recommended Split

### Research Context (What to Look For)
```
- Look for similar patterns in the years preceding World War I, World War II, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union
- Search for information about actual actions taken, not just public statements
- Prioritize recent developments and breaking news
- Look for quantitative data and expert assessments
```

### Forecast Context (How to Interpret)
```
- Assume that 2026 will be a more turbulent year than the previous 20 years
- Give much more weight to actions than to words. Assume that public political statements might serve to conceal true goals, especially statements from Trump
- Assume that politicians and companies are becoming more greedy and selfish than usual and are prioritizing short-term goals in the hope that, long-term, it will sort itself out somehow
- Give more probability to extraordinary geopolitical events happening
- Assume that Trump will use authoritarian-style ruling
```

## General Guidelines

### Put in Research Context When:
- ✅ It tells the researcher WHAT to search for
- ✅ It specifies WHERE to look (sources, time periods, topics)
- ✅ It prioritizes certain types of information
- ✅ It guides the search strategy

**Examples:**
- "Look for recent news from the past 3 months"
- "Prioritize official government sources"
- "Search for expert opinions on [topic]"
- "Look for historical precedents"

### Put in Forecast Context When:
- ✅ It tells the forecaster HOW to interpret information
- ✅ It provides assumptions about the world
- ✅ It specifies how to weight different factors
- ✅ It guides probability assignments

**Examples:**
- "Assume higher volatility than historical averages"
- "Give more weight to actions than words"
- "Account for cognitive biases"
- "Use wider confidence intervals"

## Why This Matters

**Research Context** affects:
- What information is found
- What sources are consulted
- What topics are explored
- The breadth and depth of research

**Forecast Context** affects:
- How the found information is interpreted
- What assumptions are applied
- How probabilities are assigned
- The final forecast values

## Example: How They Work Together

**Research Context**: "Look for similar patterns in years preceding major conflicts"
→ Researcher finds: "1913 had rising tensions, 1938 had appeasement policies..."

**Forecast Context**: "Assume 2026 will be more turbulent than previous 20 years"
→ Forecaster interprets: "Given the patterns found and the turbulence assumption, I assign 65% probability to conflict"

The research finds the information; the forecast context shapes how that information is used.

## Quick Decision Tree

Ask yourself:
1. **Does this tell me WHAT to search for?** → Research Context
2. **Does this tell me HOW to think about what I found?** → Forecast Context
3. **Does this tell me WHERE to look?** → Research Context
4. **Does this tell me WHAT to assume?** → Forecast Context
